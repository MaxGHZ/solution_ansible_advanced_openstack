== Overview

A monolithic repo (openstack collection, three tier app roles etc) to deploy end to end openstack three-tier-app.


=== Notes

* defaults to run from remote control node 
** To run locally on workstation just change inventory so it is localhost

NOTE: There is an ansible vault and the password is the common redhat password...

`ansible-playbook deploy-all.yml --ask-vault-pass`

=== Three playbooks

* `deploy-all.yml`
** Full deploy from zero to running app
* `deploy-openstack-three-tier-infra.yml`
** Builds Infrastructure including instances but no app
* `deploy-three-tier-app.yml` Requires existing infra (previous play), generates inventory, deploys app
